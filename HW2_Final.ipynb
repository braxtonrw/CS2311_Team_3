    "**SUBMISSION GUIDELINES**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First design, develop and test your code in a Jupyter notebook or other development environment\n",
    "   - You can expirement and try different things in this notebook\n",
    "2. Then copy your final code and markdown cells into the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) provided for the assignment and submit to Blackboard\n",
    "   - **Your submission file should be named HW2_Final.ipynb**\n",
    "   - I must be able to open and run your notebook in order to grade it\n",
    "3. Note that the Jupyter notebook provided for final submission may contain testing code to help you check that your output and expected match.  \n",
    "   - Follow the instructions in the notebook for copying your code and running the testing code\n",
    "   - The instructor may run additional tests to check that your code runs correctly\n",
    "4. If asked, also provide any supporting files or images requested in the assignment\n",
    "   - If there are multiple files to submit you should zip the files into one folder and submit the folder\n",
    "\n",
    "**GRADING CRITERIA:**\n",
    "1. Good documentation/comments and program readability using both markdown cells and code comments\n",
    "2. Algorithm/pseudo-code is explained in a markdown cell and is efficiently written\n",
    "3. Program runs correctly for test cases with no syntax errors or logical errors\n",
    "\n",
    "***The instructor should be able to reproduce your work from your notebook.***"
